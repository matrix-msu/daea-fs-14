      <h1>Marsa Matruh</h1>
      <h3>Thirteenth Century BC - Graeco-Roman Period/Modern</h3>
	  <h4>By: Nicole Brabaw</h4>
         <h3>Introduction</h3>
	<hr><!--this draws a line across the page, which I put under each section heading in the example-->
			<p>The excavations done at the site of Marsa Matruh have led to significant insight into the trade patterns of the Mediterranean. The city of Marsa Matruh is modern, built on top of the ancient city of Paraitonion. Because of modern construction, the site of Paraitonion is destroyed and not accessible for excavations <a href="#" rel="citation" data-toggle="popover" data-content="Bard, K. (2005). Marsa Matruh. In Encyclopedia of the archaeology of ancient Egypt (2nd ed., p. 565). New York: Routledge.">(Bard 2005 p. 565)</a>. Due to the fantastic work of the American archaeologist, Oric Bates, a small island near Marsa Matruh was studied in 1913 and 1914 <a href="#" rel="citation" data-toggle="popover" data-content="Bard, K. (2005). Marsa Matruh. In Encyclopedia of the archaeology of ancient Egypt (2nd ed., p. 566). New York: Routledge.">(Bard 2005 p. 566)</a>. This island was an important stop for mariners traveling across the Mediterranean because the next stops before and after Paraitonion were hundreds of kilometers away. In 1904, the French observer Fourtau originally studied Marsa Matruh and the island. He found similar findings to Bates, which clarifies that the observations are true even though they cannot be physically excavated today <a href="#" rel="citation" data-toggle="popover" data-content="Bard, K. (2005). Marsa Matruh. In Encyclopedia of the archaeology of ancient Egypt (2nd ed., p. 568). New York: Routledge.">(Bard 2005 p. 568)</a>.
			</p>
			<p>Though the island is small and the architecture is poorly preserved, many artifacts of pottery sherds and some structural buildings have been studied. This remains give great insight into what the people here traded and how they lived their lives on the island.

			<p>The city of Marsa Matruh is a port city on the northwest coast of the Mediterranean Sea. It is situated 290km west of Alexandria and 210km east of el-Salloum <a href="#" rel="citation" data-toggle-"popover" data-content="Bard, K. (2005). Marsa Matruh. In Encyclopedia of the archaeology of ancient Egypt (2nd ed., p. 564). New York: Routledge.">(Bard 2005 p.564)</a>. Matruh’s location made it very important geographically during antiquity. Because of its protected natural harbor and adjacent lagoon system, Matruh was the only reliable haven for mariners traveling the 600km distance between Alexandria and Tobruk <a href="#" rel="citation" data-toggle="popover" data-content="Bard, K. (2005). Marsa Matruh. In Encyclopedia of the archaeology of ancient Egypt (2nd ed., pp.564-65). New York: Routledge.">(Bard 2005 p.564-65)</a>. There is a small 135 by 55m sandy island off the east end of the first of five saltwater lagoons eastward of Matruh’s harbor <a href="#" rel="citation" data-toggle="popover" data-content="Bard, K.

		<h3>Site Description</h3>
	<hr>
			<p>Today Marsa Matruh is a modern resort city, but in the Graeco-Roman period it was an extremely important port city that was known as Paraitonian <a href="#" rel="citation" data-toggle="popover" data-content="Bard, K. (2005). Marsa Matruh. In Encyclopedia of the archaeology of ancient Egypt (2nd ed., p. 564). New York: Routledge.">(Bard 2005 p.564)</a>. Patraitonion was thought to be founded by Alexander the Great during the time he was visiting the Siwa Oasis in 331 BC, but this is evidently not true. Unfortunately, any evidence of the city of Paraitonian has been covered today by the city of Marsa Matruh, but the most likely location for it would be the coastal plain directly south of the harbor. Archaeological remains indicate that there was some kind of settlement that was contacting Greece through trade as early as the eighth century BC. And even before that evidence shows that at least one area of Matruh was used in the fourteenth and possibly thirteenth century BC. This area was most likely a way-station for Late Bronze Age mariners coming from Cyprus. This area was named Bate’s Island, named after Oric Bates <a href="#" rel="citation" data-toggle="popover" data-content="Bard, K. (2005). Marsa Matruh. In Encyclopedia of the archaeology of ancient Egypt (2nd ed., p. 565). New York: Routledge.">(Bard 2005 p. 565)</a>. 
			</p>
			<p>A Ramesside fortress near the island, at Umm el-Rakham, indicates the possibility that pharaoh’s used the island as a harbor as early as the nineteenth dynasty <a href="#" rel="citation" data-toggle="popover" data-content="Bard, K. (2005). Marsa Matruh. In Encyclopedia of the archaeology of ancient Egypt (2nd ed., p. 565). New York: Routledge.">(Bard 2005 p. 565)</a>. The island was highly inhabited during the Late Bronze Age, mostly on the island’s lower sandstone ridge which implies that the insular setting of the island was a lot smaller than it is today, but better protected. Overall, the Late Bronze Age architectural remains on the island are poorly preserved. Although there is evidence of a bronze workshop on the island, suggesting that simple bronze tools were cast on the island for local exchange, and it’s possible that people bartered finished craft goods for food and water as a crucial means for the islanders’ operations. The existence of this remote port site is not explained by the motivation for a short-term profit, but a greater framework of understanding of the Late Bronze Age trade does. Ship-borne Cypriot products have been discovered all over the eastern Mediterranean from Crete, to the eastern Nile Delta, and all the way to the Levantine coast. Crete lies 420km northwest of Matruh and was possibly the final point west for traders coming from the eastern Mediterranean <a href="#" rel="citation" data-toggle="popover" data-content="Bard, K. (2005). Marsa Matruh. In Encyclopedia of the archaeology of ancient Egypt (2nd ed., p. 566). New York: Routledge.">(Bard 2005 p.566)</a>. Matruh was likely the closest and safest landfall available for mariners leaving Crete against the strong north-westerly winds along the coast <a href="#" rel="citation" data-toggle="popover" data-content="Bard, K. (2005). Marsa Matruh. In Encyclopedia of the archaeology of ancient Egypt (2nd ed., p. 567). New York: Routledge.">(Bard 2005 p. 567)</a>.
			</p>
			<p>Local trade must have been mostly done with the Berber Libyans which is reflected in the presence of Libyan handmade, coarse ware pottery, a few stone tools, and many ostrich eggshell fragments that were found in the Late Bronze Age strata on the island. During the eighteenth dynasty the Matruh area seems to have provided eastern Mediterranean traders with fresh water and food supplies from the mainland Libyans, and perhaps locally manufactured bronze tools, in exchange for the standard trade goods routinely transported by boat. Life was most likely difficult in the winter, though, since storms would make it hard to access while the Libyans were moving their flocks south <a href="#" rel="citation" data-toggle="popover" data-content="Bard, K. (2005). Marsa Matruh. In Encyclopedia of the archaeology of ancient Egypt (2nd ed., p. 567). New York: Routledge.">(Bard 2005 p.567)</a>. 
			</p>
			<p>Some form of settlement at Marsa Matruh had to have preceded Alexander the Great’s visit, but the town of Paraitonion is clearly linked with the Ptolemaic, Roman and Byzantine periods. And after the division of Alexander the Great’s empire, Paraitonion was administratively united with Ptolemaic Egypt <a href="#" rel="citation" data-toggle="popover" data-content="Bard, K. (2005). Marsa Matruh. In Encyclopedia of the archaeology of ancient Egypt (2nd ed., p. 567). New York: Routledge.">(Bard 2005 p. 567)</a>. Artifacts and wall remains found on the island date from the sixth century BC to the fourth/fifth centuries AD, but the town’s Graeco-Roman development is more clearly evident on the mainland <a href="#" rel="citation" data-toggle="popover" data-content="Bard, K. (2005). Marsa Matruh. In Encyclopedia of the archaeology of ancient Egypt (2nd ed., pp. 567-68). New York: Routledge.">(Bard 2005 p. 567-68)</a>. Also on the mainland, west of Bate’s Island, a crest of a low outcropping of rock that is still littered with Roman period sherds, has traces of some kind of ancient industrial facility. This facility may have been associated with dyeing given that murex shells were found in great numbers on the island <a href="#" rel="citation" data-toggle="popover" data-content="Bard, K. (2005). Marsa Matruh. In Encyclopedia of the archaeology of ancient Egypt (2nd ed., p. 568). New York: Routledge.">(Bard 2005 p. 568)</a>.
			</p>
			<p>Marc Antony and Cleopatra VII briefly resided in Paraitonion after their defeat at Actium in 32 BC. And there are few historical facts known about Paraitonion after their deaths. And later in 69 AD, Vespasian occupied Paratonion during the civil war, which led to his elevation as emperor. Prior to the Byzantine period, when the town was considered regionally important, Paraitonion was mainly remembered as a source for a greasy, soft white mineral coloring agent called paraetonium <a href="#" rel="citation" data-toggle="popover" data-content="Bard, K.

			<p>Oric Bates was an American archaeologist who surveyed Marsa Matruh during 1913 and 1914 for Harvard’s Peabody Museum. Due to the rise in the water levels throughout the lagoon system during the fourteenth century BC, no early artifacts were retrieved from the island below 2.5m above sea level. During Graeco-Roman times, the upper levels of the rubble walls of the Late Bronze Age structures were completely destroyed for reuse. And in more recent times, a 12.5 by 12.9m shelter was built that eventually housed sponge-divers in the seventeenth and early eighteenth centuries. Much of the island’s Late Bronze Age pottery was found inside or near the sponge divers’ house, which clearly divides a cluster of Late Bronze Age remains to its north and south. This suggests that a single line of small attached rooms and enclosures covered most of the island’s north to south spine during the Late Bronze Age period. North of the divers’ are structural remains, mostly sections of isolated walls. Pottery found here suggests that the area was used for storage and domestic activities. Then south of the house the structural remains are more plentiful. At least three of these rooms are strung out in a stepped-out pattern along the island’s spine. Inside one of the structures was a stone oven covered with a ceramic piece and a stone bin. And inside another structure were traces of two furnaces and bronze scraps indicating a possible bronze casting workshop. The walls in these structures were flat, undressed field stones brought in from the mainland and laid in rough courses. Some walls were coated with white or green plaster on the inside. And the superstructures may have been constructed of mudrick or wattle and daub, but there is little evidence for that. There is even a lack of evidence for doors and windows on the structures. The floors of the buildings were just made of the island’s natural bedrock surface covered in layers of trampled sand. And for exterior spaces, paving stone was used. All of the spacial units were small, reflecting the overall cramped size of the island. The majority of the Late Bronze Age strata finds on the island were potsherds, apart from animal bones and shells. Most of the pottery was imported from Cyprus, both fine and coarse wares. While a small number of contemporary Minoan and Mycenaean sherds were also found <a href="#" rel="citation" data-toggle="popover" data-content="Bard, K. (2005). Marsa Matruh. In Encyclopedia of the archaeology of ancient Egypt (2nd ed., p. 566). New York: Routledge.">(Bard 2005 p. 566)</a>.
			</p>
			<p>A major find of Oric Bate’s was five burials on the long ridge southeast of the modern Marsa Matruh. The burials were elliptical pits cut in to the ridge’s soft bedrock. Two of them were still intact with the human remains and grave goods still inside. Of the grave goods, Bate’s found two small, well-made stone vessels, many handmade ceramic jars, a small stone “mortar” and a number of aquatic shells, three of which were thought to be of Nilotic origin <a href="#" rel="citation" data-toggle="popover" data-content="Bard, K. (2005). Marsa Matruh. In Encyclopedia of the archaeology of ancient Egypt (2nd ed., p. 567). New York: Routledge.">(Bard 2005 p. 567)</a>. Bates also observed urban remains spreading south of the southeast corner of Matruh’s first east lagoon and also a set of rock-cut stairs associated with a rock-cut chamber, possibly another burial. This chamber lead towards the lagoon’s edge and may have been associated with a dock at one time <a href="#" rel="citation" data-toggle="popover" data-content="Bard, K. (2005). Marsa Matruh. In Encyclopedia of the archaeology of ancient Egypt (2nd ed., p. 568). New York: Routledge.">(Bard 2005 p. 568)</a>.
			</p>
			<p>In 1904, the French observer Fourtau identified remains of a large ancient rock-cut pier, with a series of stone jetties projecting into the water, at the southeast corner of the deep lagoon west of Matruh’s harbor. The pier was marked by stone towers at both ends and more than 2km of urban remains, including a large domestic villa, were visible to Fourtau along the lagoon’s south shore. Interestingly, a decade later Bate’s took note of the same kind of development that Fourtau saw along the southern and eastern shorelines of the west lagoon. One area that Bate’s observed that is still visible today is part of a defensive wall that sealed off the western end of the ridge-top settlement that he attributed to the sixth century AD (Justinianic Period). Fourtau also noted a ridge-top cemetery in the same general area <a href="#" rel="citation" data-toggle="popover" data-content="Bard, K. (2005). Marsa Matruh. In Encyclopedia of the archaeology of ancient Egypt (2nd ed., p. 568). New York: Routledge.">(Bard 2005 p. 568)</a>.
			</p>
			<p>In the 1930s, 12km west of town, a well-preserved line of a Roman period aqueduct was studied. It is assumed that it supplied the ridge settlement with water. Bates then recorded ten cemeteries and eight tombs of mainly Roman-Byzantine date that were associated with either the “Great Ridge” south of the modern Marsa Matruh or with the regions to its west and southwest. He also excavated three large rock-cut toms not far inland from the harbor at Matruh today. These same rock-cut tombs were later reported by Hakfet Abdel-Razek Krim <a href="#" rel="citation" data-toggle="popover" data-content="Bard, K. (2005). Marsa Matruh. In Encyclopedia of the archaeology of ancient Egypt (2nd ed., p. 568). New York: Routledge.">(Bard 2005 p. 568)</a>.

		<h3>Conclusion</h3>
	<hr>
			<p>Marsa Matruh is a very important site historically because of its function as a harbor city along the Mediterranean coast. The ancient city of Paraitonion and Bate’s Island were crucial in aiding mariners traveling across the Mediterranean Sea. Even though the city of Paraitonion itself cannot be excavated due to modern construction, Bate’s Island is a great excavation point. The findings of Oric Bates and Fourtau give great understanding of what life was like along the Mediterranean during the Late Bronze Age and on.
