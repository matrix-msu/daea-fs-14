      <h1>Heit el-Ghurab</h1>
         <h3>Fourth Dynasty</h3>
<h4>By: Jason Lambracht</h4>
         <h3>Introduction</h3>
		 <hr>
		 <p>Since 1988, excavations have been carried out in a region at Giza about 400 meters to the south and 200 meters to the east of the Sphinx (2). The goal of these excavations, a part of the Giza Plateau Mapping Project, was to locate evidence of the pyramid builders; namely any social and or economic structures that could support the enormous needs that the pyramid construction projects required (4).</p>
		 <p>Although this site has only been excavated for the past 20 years, is nowhere near completion, and contains portions buried under modern constructs, we have learned that this settlement served as an administrative hub during the constructions of the fourth dynasty pyramids, and more specifically as homes to the pyramid builders, as well as the production facilities for all those involved in this great project (1)(4).</p>
		 <p>Activities performed here are as numerous and diverse as the Egyptian people themselves and include bread making, brewing, animal raising, pottery production, copper working, stone working, brick making, quarrying, and construction (4). While the site is incredibly expansive, the majority of activities can be found divided into three distinct zones, each offering a wealth of information as to who these people were and how they lived.</p>

		 <p>Heit el-Ghurab is an Old Kingdom settlement from the Third Millennium B.C. It is located approximately 400 meters south, and 200 meters east of the Sphinx at Giza. The target area for excavation was the east-southeast part of the Giza Plateau, at the foot of the Maadi Formation from the Upper Eocene. This location lies beyond the stone quarries used for pyramid core stone, and its proximity to the main wadi connects it to the valley and harbors for non-local materials. It is also located approximately 250 meters from the “Worker’s Cemetery.” Heit el-Ghurab lies in a large tract of low desert that is buried by clean sand that filled it in shortly after its short occupation. Over the years this sand has been used by village boys for cleaning stables and returned to the area. Just below this layer of sand lies the Third Millennium B.C. remains and deposits mixed with a compacted surface of gray soil or “mud mass” caused by the toppling of the mud-brick walls. The eastern part of the site has been lost to heavy machinery activity just prior to excavations, and the southern part of the site is currently occupied by the Abu el-Hol Sports Club Soccer field and therefore cannot be excavated (4).</p>
		 <br>
	<h3>Site Description</h3>
	<hr>
	<p>Excavations first began here in 1988, but didn’t really take off until a 21-month period from the Fall of 1999 to June 2002. For the past 20 years excavations have slowly uncovered the layout of this massive encampment. At the northern end of the site lies its most prominent feature; The “Wall of the Crow”, a 10 meter high, 200 meter long, stone wall for which the site was named for (1)(4). Nearly centered on the wall is a large gate that opens up to the far western edge of the site. Moving south from the gate is the western edge of two small compounds: the Western Compound and the Eastern Compound. Separating these is an enclosure wall that stretches south by southeast, eventually curving and running east for about three quarters of the complexes width. Surrounding this wall are three very distinct urban development areas (Galleries, Western Town, and Eastern Town)(2). These urban centers differ in their layout, design, structures, overall size, and most importantly by the makeup of their remains, including unique flora, fauna, ceramic, and lithic artifact patterns. Even though a large enclosure wall separates them, they are linked together by numerous streets and gates (1)(2)(4). The Galleries lie at the heart of the settlement and make up nearly 40% of the site. In the south and to the east of the Galleries is the Royal Administration Building, while further east is Eastern Town. South of the Galleries on the western edge is Western Town (2).</p>
	<p>Erosion has stripped the ruins to waist or even ankle level. However, because of this, major walls can be seen with only shallow excavation, often only brushing away the very surface. Evidence points to an abrupt abandonment of this site at the end of the fourth dynasty and nearly everything of value was removed at this time (4). What remains is the key to unlocking the secret of who built the pyramids.</p>

		 <h3>Excavations and Results</h3>
		 <hr>
		 <p>Occupation of the site was from the middle to the the late fourth dynasty during the times of second and third great pyramid construction projects. Both pottery sherds and mud sealings have contributed to the dating of Heit el-Ghurab (5). Overall, excavations up until June of 2002 have uncovered over 500,000 pottery fragments, 150,000 of which can be identified as a type of vessel. Roughly half are bread molds, while crude red ware jars and bowls are next in abundance (5). Of interesting note is a hemispherical bodied red ware bowl called CD7, the surface of which is covered in a white wash, making it entirely unique to Giza. Also found in large quantities were fragments of clay sealings (1,427 in total), 50 of which either entirely contain, or can be extrapolated into, the names of the Pharoahs' Khafre and Menkaure. There is evidence to suggest that the site was purposely dismantled after its temporary use, but contained some occupation after Menkaure’s reign, most notably squatters (4).</p>
		 <p>“The Wall of the Crow”</p>
		 <p>Heit el-Ghurab literally translates to “The Wall of the Crow” and until 1988, that was all that was uncovered in this area. There is a sharp contrast between the two sides of this massive wall. To the south is the site of Heil el-Ghurab rich with architecture, material remains, and other archeological evidence, while the north side of the wall contains no built structures and little other archaeological artifacts. There are ephemeral installations, however, these were created on a surface of limestone rubble extending 30 meters to the north. On the eastern edge of the wall lies “mason’s mound,” an embankment that contains a construction ramp. Just south of the wall is the western compound and south of that is a small double stone, walled structure known as “The Chute" (4).</p>
	<figure style="padding:10px">
		 <img src="http://www.aeraweb.org/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/LCWOC3.jpg">
		 <figcaption><a href="#" rel="citation" data-toggle="popover" data-content="Image 3. The Wall of the Crow. Flickr.">Image 3</a></figcaption>
		 </figure>
		 <p>The Chute</p>
		 <p>This interesting structure begins 12 meters west of the West Gate and stretches west by northwest, then turning due north ending at the gate in The Wall of the Crow. This is a very restrictive corridor (averaging 2.6 meters wide) that could have been used to control and count animals being led for slaughter. It is composed of limestone blocks 1.45 meters wide, and has a “skin” wall composed of a mix of materials including stone, sand, and broken pottery. It ends to the east in an open area in front of the West Gate and contains large amounts of animal bone including sheep and cattle. One of the impressive finds in this area shows how much Egyptians modified their terrain. Below the surface of The Chute’s walls shows thick dumped deposits that Egyptians used to fill in and raise the area. The Chute seems to surround the Western Compound along with The Wall of the Crow to the north, and the Enclosure Wall to the east. The Western Compound contains enormous dumps composed of pottery waste and ash as well as numerous bakeries (4).</p>
		 <p>Galleries</p>
		 <p>The “Galleries” is a set of four distinct urban complexes (numbered I-IV from north to south), rectangular in shape, running south, from the Wall of the Crow to South Street - just shy of the southern Enclosure Wall. Gallery unit I is bordered to the south by North Street, while Main Street divides Gallery units II & III and leads to the only gate in the bordering enclosure wall. Gallery units III & IV are not separated by a street and instead are joined together and bordered to the south by South Street (2). Each Gallery unit is approximately 35 meters wide, approximately twice that in length, and composed of up to 185,000 mud-bricks (4).</p>
		 <p>Gallery units are divided into two main areas. The western area is further subdivided into Galleries numbered 1 – 8 (in most cases). Based on the excavation of Gallery III.4, a central bench ran the length of the building embedded with support stone bases every five cubits or so, possibly used for supporting wooden columns. These individual Galleries contained numerous bed platforms. It is unclear whether these served as housing for workers or a royal guard, but excavated material culture shows parallels to other centrally provisioned sites from the fourth dynasty used namely for workers during damn construction and quarries (1). Towards the southern end of the Galleries further walls divided up the area into room compartments that resemble houses, complete with a small vestibule, a main room, and an inner, sleeping room. The far southern end contains evidence of use as a kitchen, including evidence of roasting and baking complete with bread mold sherds; although this differs among galleries as some may have been used for the production of small copper objects or the preparation of pigment. The Eastern half of the Gallery units contained a much larger, more open space that possibly served as a “manor” for the overseer. It is as wide as three Galleries and was well maintained and decorated during occupancy. Here there is evidence of red paint, and the presence of one or more bakeries attached to the eastern side. Each Gallery that has been excavated is unique and each Gallery unit even more so. These massive structures contain evidence that points to a multitude of uses including the drying and preservation of meats, fish, and grains; numerous bakeries; and worker housing. Of particular note is the eastern portion of Gallery unit III that shows a common area, The Hypostyle Hall that could have been used as a large communal dining hall. Together these Galleries could have housed close to 2,000 people, all eating together, sleeping together, and in close quarters, which promoted a very strong espirit de corps (4).</p>
		 <p>Furthermore the orthogonal layout of the Galleries is the hallmark of central authority in Egypt, or top-down administration, and is in fact one of the earliest sites to demonstrate this. While the Galleries were more gender restricted and may have only housed males, the surrounding settlements were in fact gender-balanced, showing a communal living of employed workers. East of the Galleries is a large area used for widespread dumping. They show early faience production, and form a leveled area in which bakeries and pedestals were built during later site use (1)(3)(4).</p>

		 </figure>
		 <p>The Royal Administration Building</p>
		 <p>The Royal Administration Building is a large multi-room building separated from the Galleries and Eastern Town by large masonry walls, with later remodels adding silos and covering the streets surrounding this complex. This created very controlled access where the only point of entrance to the building would have been an opening in the covered street at the northeast corner, which also allowed the only access to Western Town from the Galleries and Eastern Town. Unfortunately, the RAB is one of the buildings that lie partially underneath of the Abu el-Hol Sports Club making it impossible to fully excavate (1)(4).</p>
		 <p>Eastern Town</p>
		 <p>Eastern Town shows signs of self-organization as evidenced by a distinct urban pattern containing small courts, and small houses (compared to Western Town). One excavation of a small estate, composed of a house and its surrounding courtyard approximately 100 sq. meters in size, showed more erratic smaller streets and passages, small hearths, silos, and material remains that reflect a more village economy as evidenced by a high density and variety of plant remains as well as pig raising. The ratio of pigs to cattle shows that people of a lower class than Western Town occupied this portion of the settlement. The layout of this urban area extends from Main Street to the north to the Abu el-Hol Sports Club in the south. It also runs eastward under the current town of Nazlet es-Samman (1)(4).</p>
		 <p>Western Town</p>
		 <p>Large houses, more uniform orthogonal street development, and large production buildings characterize Western Town. Houses here are quite large as evidenced by the excavation of House Unit 1, which spans 400 sq. meters. This housing unit contains 21 rooms including a private bedroom with a double bed platform, and red and black painted, plastered walls. While most of the other rooms were used as storage, at least one room was a fully equipped bakery as evidenced by the dark ashy fills accumulated at the site, and the presence of an oven and a vat. However, the presence of low bins and vats also suggests that this may have served double duty as a bakery and a brewery. This is further evidenced by the presence of beer-jar fragments found in a nearby massive dump. Material remains found in a mound in-between two of the larger houses include large amounts of cattle bones and formal sealings indicating its occupation by high-ranking members of an administration class. To the far west of the region lies Area AA, which contains the “Pedestal Building”. This building was built on pedestals on the western side of a thick wall composed of fieldstone and mud-brick. It’s unique layout shows that it could have been used for malt production due to the presence of specialized storage compartments. Overall, Western Town was home to the elite class and administrators, as evidenced by the layout and material remains found during excavations (1)(2)(4).</p>
		 <p>Site Development Phases</p>
		 <p>There is distinct archaeological evidence that shows that this site went through some distinct phases of development. For example: Gallery I predates the “Wall of the Crow”; Gallery III was built before Gallery IV as evidenced by its southern walls and doorways; the RAB was remodeled and added covering to the streets, and sunken courtyard silos; the enclosure wall was built after the RAB and eventually formed up with the RAB’s south wall; Western Town was built after the Enclosure Wall; and even earlier still, the site may have been home to faience production, and then later bread production before it became home to the pyramid builders (1)(4).</p>
		 <p>While the site was not occupied for any great length, there are signs of remodeling within many of the structures. After the site was abandoned it suffered major erosion, as evidenced in Western Town. Later the area of Western Town was used as an outlying tomb as part of an Old Kingdom cemetery that was built over the site. Above that are dozens of Late Period burials that are also found in the thousands at the northwest section of the site (4).</p>
		 <p>Even though the site is partially covered by the modern soccer field there are substantial architectural remains further to the south, past the soccer field. Named the Standing Wall Islands, these remains are mud-brick and limestone 1.5 meters tall, although they are aligned differently than the buildings at Heit el-Ghurab (3).</p>
		 <p>Overall</p>
		 <p>Heit el-Ghurab was a thriving urban city, even if only during a short occupation. Egyptian workers were fed well as evidenced by the high cattle to pig ratios from 6:1 to an upwards of 16:1 in certain areas. They possibly fed 7000 to 10,000 people a day between 200 to 300 grams of animal meat. While Heit el-Ghurab was a city that was slowly built to meet the needs of pyramid construction, its social order was very natural. Authorities and planners built the Galleries with the layout and materials of traditional Egyptian homes. They were relatively open, and were more public in front and private in the back; much like other Egyptian homes built during this time. Numerous bone points, rods, copper needles, and spindle wheels have been found that correspond to primarily women’s activities of weaving and spinning. This helps us understand Heit el-Ghurab as more of a city in its function, complete with a balance of genders, than as a temporary worker camp. Because of the diversity of form, function, material component, and layout of the three distinct zones, Heit el-Ghurab can be seen as a town, village, and barracks that were pieced together to form a large urban complex (1)(3)(4).</p>
		 <br>
		 <h3>Conclusion</h3>
		 <hr>
		 <p>Heit el-Ghurab played a major role in the development of Egypt during the fourth Dynasty. It has been stated numerous times that the greater question is not how the Egyptians built the pyramids, but how the pyramids built Egypt. The process of uniting a nation for a common goal as large as this was would have given Egyptians a sense of unity, identity, and purpose. This complex connectedness was further propelled by numerous interactions between households and not from centralized decision-making found in other cultures and later in Egypt. The numerous additions, remodeling, and multiplication of households present, show this importance of the household as the fundamental social unit.</p>

		 </figure>
		 <p>However there are still many unanswered questions… Why is there no boundary wall above the Galleries? It could have been that Gallery I itself served as a wall, or it was bounded on that side by a northeast harbor delivery area. Where is the water storage area that should be present at a large site like this? They possibly used water from the nearby Nile channel (only 200 meters away), or from a nearby harbor; although this would have required a large investment of time and people. Where are the latrines? While you wouldn’t necessarily expect to find formal latrines inside the complex, there should be evidence of organic material outside of the sites boundaries at the very least… so far none has been found. Where are the cult/religious centers? While chapels would not be in use before the Middle Kingdom, no areas for worship have been found during excavations. However, no formal cult areas for worship have been found in other similar sites elsewhere at Giza. Why is there a lack of inscribed material? While paradoxical in a site administering resources at this time in Egypt, perhaps local matters were left to local council, or were handled directly by central administration.</p>
		 <p>Overall the site shows some great insight to Egyptian urbanism. Sites like Heit el-Ghurab and other single purpose sites including workmen villages, quarry settlements, and forts, are not representative of Egypt’s numerous settlements. These unique sites show the diversity of Egyptians in both form and function. Attempts to categorize sites like Heit el-Ghurab are problematic. Size, occupancy, and longevity are the main characteristics of determining a “city” and as such Heit el-Ghurab falls into the category of a worker’s camp, as it was designated a temporary settlement and dismantled after the completion of the pyramids. However, due to the size of the structures (namely the Galleries), the fact that it functioned at least for the reigns of Khafre and Menkaure, and the presence of central administration, its role as an important city during the fourth Dynasty is cemented.</p>
